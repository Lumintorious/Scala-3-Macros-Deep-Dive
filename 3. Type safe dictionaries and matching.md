# Type safe dictionaries and Matching

## Intention
We would like to implement a form of dictionary (or map) that is immutable and remembers all the types of it's initialized values.  
There is something very similar currently in Scala 3: the **Selectable** trait with **Refinement** types, but there are a couple of issues:
  1. The selectable trait lacks an implementation and it helps only with the access of values
  1. When you create a Selectable implementation, you have to cast each created object to a refinement matching it's internal map
  1. There is no type inference when creating them, you would have to declare all types each time
  1. The syntax for creating key-value Selectables involves one of two ways, none of which resemble the syntax of refinement types:  
    a) A list of tuples akin to `obj("key" -> value)`  
    b) A dynamic object with an `applyDynamicNamed` resulting in `obj(key = value)`

We could make our own `Dict` type whose creation resembles refinement type declarations

## Example
This is how we want our client code to look like:
```scala
// mike is automatically type-inferred by the macro as Dict { val name: String, val age: Int, val likesMacros: Boolean } 
val mike = Dict {
  val name = "Mike"
  val age = 28
  val likesMacros = true
}

println(mike.name) // Works fine, type resolves to String
println(mike.wallet) // ERROR, mike has no 'wallet'

// Notice how this type's declaration resembles the variable mike's initialization almost perfectly
type Programmer = Dict {
  val name: String
  val age: Int
  val likesMacros: Boolean
}

val mikeProgrammer: Programmer = mike // Works

type OfficeBuilding = Dict {
  val address: String
  val stories: Int
}

val mikeOfficeBuilding: OfficeBuilding = mike // ERROR, mike doesn't have the fields of an OfficeBuilding
```

## Implementation
### Good to know beforehand:
Could be a good idea to look over the previous examples in this repo
The `Selectable` trait in Scala 3 and how it works, [Link to documentation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/types-structural.html)
Most entities in a Quotes context have unapply methods that make matching very easy

Structure of entities used in this example:
The ValDef resembles `ValDef(name: String, tpt: TypeTree, rhs: Option[Term]`, is a type of `Definition` where:
  - `name` is the name of the declared variable
  - `tpt` is the `TypeTree` of the declaration, `TypeTree` can be turned into a `TypeRepr` with `tpt.tpe`
  - `rhs` is the right-hand side term of the declaration, if it is an abstract val, this is `None`

The Refinement TypeRepr resembles `Refinement(parent: TypeRepr, name: String, info: TypeRepr)` where:
  - `parent` is the predecesor of this type, Refinement types act like a linked list, each refinement object represents only one `val` definition and it's type, to have a refinement of multiple definitions, you need to nest them using the `parent` field, the last refinement should point to a base `TypeRepr`
  - `name` is the name of this refinement's val definition
  - `info` is the type representation of this refinement's val definition

The `Type` type is a Quotes-agnostic type that represents type-level entities like `String` or `List[Int]` or `"Hello" | "World"`.  
You can obtain these by accessing `(tpe: TypeRepr).asType` and you can use them in injected expressions by doing a match on them:
```scala
val typeReprOfString = TypeRepr.of[String] // This is an example, but this could be gotten from reflection, unknown here
val myExpr = typeReprOfString.asType match {
  case '[myType] => ${
    summon[myType]
    val list = List.empty[myType]
    // ...etc, it is a type-level name in here, the match is exhaustive
  }
}
```
